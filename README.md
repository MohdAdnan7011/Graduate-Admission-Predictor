# Graduate-Admission-Predictor
Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict graduate admission probabilities based on key factors such as GRE and TOEFL scores, university ratings, CGPA, and research experience. Leveraged MinMaxScaler for data preprocessing and scaling to enhance model efficiency. Developed a 2-layer neural network using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving impressive performance with minimal validation loss. Trained the model with the Adam optimizer over 100 epochs and validated it using an 80-20 train-test split. This project highlighted strong analytical abilities and showcased the practical application of deep learning techniques to solve real-world challenges.
